        "bodyText": "Right, that’s all for today’s clockwatch, the end of my view from the afternoon. It’s never dull in THIS LEAGUE is it? Or indeed in the Championship, or lower down, to be fair. Anticipation has a habit to set you up for disappointment. Yet this evening’s entertainment comes from Anfield via Liverpool and Arsenal. Enjoy it. And David Hytner was at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium to watch a very, er, watchable game between two enterprising teams, with Spurs just holding off Everton for the three points. Richarlison is back, baby. Paul MacInnes’ report from an emotional Luton has also landed. Townsend wins it for the Town against the Toon. Manchester United fans, look away now. Dom Solanke deserves the headlines at the City Ground, but a certain red card decision might dominate the talking points instead, reports Ben Fisher. John Brewin’s report is in from Craven Cottage, where Burnley caused a stir in a major pre-Christmas boost for Vinny Kompany. That Luton win was for Locks. Classy stuff. The headlines lower down the leagues are that Bolton managed to hold off a spirited Leyton Orient comeback to win 3-2 after being 3-0 up. Meanwhile, Portsmouth were held 1-1 by Fleetwood, as struggling Reading beat Wigan 2-0 and Stevenage were beaten 2-1 at Barnsley despite scoring early on. In League Two, Wrexham continued their good form with a 2-0 win over fellow Welsh side Newport, while there were impressive away wins for Harrogate (2-1 at Grimsby), MK Dons (3-1 at Morecambe) and Mansfield (2-0 at Sutton). Nottingham Forest v Bournemouth went into the 101st minute, but referee Rob Jones eventually brings it to an end, with the Cherries grabbing an entertaining 3-2 victory courtesy of Dominic Solanke’s hat-trick. Referee Jones might well dominate the headlines after this one, too, for his decision to send Willy Boly off in the first half for two bookable offences. The second one in particular looked harsh and Forest will feel very much aggrieved. Fulham 0-2 Burnley Luton 1-0 Newcastle Nottm Forest 2-3 Bournemouth Tottenham 2-1 Everton One regular day, that’s all I ask, etc etc. Blackburn 1-2 Watford Leicester 3-0 Rotherham Boro 1-0 West Brom Norwich 2-0 Huddersfield Plymouth 3-3 Birmingham QPR 0-1 Southampton Sheffield Weds 1-2 Cardiff Stoke 0-0 Millwall Sunderland 0-3 Coventry A towering header from Solanke and he’s won it and completed his hat-trick in the same breath! What a brilliant moment for the striker, but a real punch in the stomach for Forest in Nuno’s first game. It’s over at Craven Cottage. Time is running out for Newcastle. They’ve not threatened anywhere near enough against a stoic Luton outfit this afternoon. There seems to be more chance of a late goal at Forest, with both sides pushing to nick the three points, even though Bournemouth have the extra man. Tottenham v Everton is into six minutes of added time. The Toffees have a set-piece opportunity, which Pickford will send long and forward. Plymouth have levelled late on against Birmingham. Morgan Whittaker makes it 3-3. Championship: Cardiff might have nicked it late on at Sheffield Wednesday, as Kion Etete makes it 2-1 to the Bluebirds. Watford have also turned things around against Blackburn with two goals in five minutes – they also lead 2-1. The forgotten man returns. We’re heading towards added time in north London. Everton need a goal. League Two: Wrexham 2-0 Newport in the Welsh derby all Welsh affair at the Racecourse Ground. Spurs are scrambling to keep Everton out here. Danjuma has a shot, which brings about a good save from Vicario, and the resulting corner causes chaos in the hosts’ box, before they eventually get it away. Fine effort from Everton who continue to go in search of a point. Welcome back, Andre Gomes. Check this goal out this evening if you can. Brilliant strike! On his first competitive Everton appearance since May 2022, the midfielder provides a moment of magic. He’s had a great game since coming on, and this goal sets up a grandstand finish, as the away fans make themselves heard. Some full-time scores from Serie A: Frosinone 1-2 Juventus; Bologna 1-0 Atalanta; Torino 1-1 Udinese. Roma v Napoli is tonight’s headline fixture in Italian football. Ought to be tasty. 15 minutes left at Tottenham: Everton are throwing the kitchen sink at Spurs, but it’s simply not happening for them. James Garner has grazed a post, Jack Harrison has come close and, despite Everton’s second half point warranting at least a goal, none has been forthcoming. Dyche is about to chuck Beto into the mix. He’s not giving up. Joy for Nuno! Was that Chris Wood who got the final touch? It was scrappy, but the home supporters at the City Ground care not one jot. Now Forest have to try and cling on. A point is surely the best they can hope for with 10 men against this in-form and organised Bournemouth team. Championship update: Some more goals. Leicester 3-0 Rotherham; Plymouth 2-3 Birmingham; Norwich 2-0 Huddersfield; Sheff Weds 1-1 Cardiff. Tottenham v Everton is in stasis. The patterns continue to repeate themselves. Spurs playing out, trying to grab another goal to secure their position, often getting caught out by Everton’s canny Dychian press. You feel an Everton goal could turn the tide, but their profligacy in forward areas is costing them a shot at a point. Championship: Oh no, Michael Beale. His Sunderland side are now 3-0 down against Coventry. Some debut. Team news is dropping over at Liverpool v Arsenal, the big one at Anfield, which you can follow with Barry Glendenning: An update from Scotland via reader Simon McMahon: Hi Dom. All three home sides, that’s Celtic, Hearts and Kilmarnock, are currently leading 2-0 against Livingston, St. Mirren and St. Johnstone respectively. Though to be honest I don’t really care about any of that as I’m still in the huff after Dundee United could only draw 0-0 with bottom of the table Queen’s Park in Glasgow last night. Though quite why I was surprised is a surprise in itself, given we’ve won about twice at Hampden in 110 years. Anyway, Merry Christmas! Thanks Simon, have a good one! Sander Berge with a super solo effort! He just went on and on and on … and then he scored. Open the claret, Clarets, your boys are in dreamland! This would be a lovely early Christmas present for Vincent Kompany, all things considered. Drama in League One! Bolton were 3-0 up on Leyton Orient but now it’s 3-2! Fleetwood have levelled at table-topping Portsmouth. The big boys are not having things their own way. Newcastle have come close to levelling at Luton. Isak had the ball in the net but it was rightly ruled out. Can the Toon find a way past Rob Edwards’ resilient side? Championship: In the blink of an eye, Leicester have a 2-0 lead over Rotherham, with Patson Daka patting and dakking in both goals. ‘Clear and obvious’, two words to suck the festive cheer out of anyone … as Sean Orlowicz emails in: Discussion in the Everton v Spurs broadcast is where exactly the clear and obvious error is. The linesman and on-field ref have two distinct and clear views of the “foul” and chose not to call it. Dyche and Everton fans are right to be upset about that one. Big Dom Solanke at the double! And trouble for Nuno, now that Bournemouth have a couple. The Cherries have turned this game on its head and, with a man advantage, they’ll be confident of seeing it out. Mike Dean on Sky Sports said that foul from Andre Gomes on Emerson Royal that denied Everton a goal was “very, very soft”. Personally, having seen it, I think it had to be given. No doubt Evertonians will vehemently disagree and email me to say so. This League Two graphic saves me a task. Thanks guys; here’s the latest … Championship: Norwich find a way through against Huddersfield via substitute Sam McCallum, who was introduced at half-time. It didn’t take him long to make a mark. This may well explain Cristian Romero’s half-time withdrawal: The answer to the question ‘can Forest cling on?’ is a resounding ‘no’. Bournemouth hit back straight away through Dominic Solanke. A mixed few minutes for players named Dominic. They all have my full support, come what may. Calvert-Lewin scores and it’s game on at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. Or does he score? There are widespread boos from the home fans, appealing for a possible foul in the buildup, and we’re getting a VAR check … it was Gomes on Royal and Stuart Attwell checks the monitor. NO GOAL! Disallowed due to that infringement. We’re back at 2-0. Rhythm is a dancer, Anthony Elanga! Another goal against the run of proceedings, but what a precious strike it is for Forest and new manager Nuno. Chris Wood set it up, Elanga finished and now most of the City Ground will hope and pray their team can cling on. 50 mins: Jacob Brown smashes one off the woodwork for Luton … oh so close to a 2-0 lead that, you feel, would prove terminal for Newcastle this afternoon. Wilson Odobert take a bow! Stunning goal. That comes rather against the run of play and against most people’s expectations. Fulham have some work to do. They won’t be winning this home game 5-0. Spurs bring on Eric Dier for Cristian Romero at half-time, which is odd given that first 45 minutes was a rare spell of football for Romero in which he wasn’t actually booked. He loves a card more than Clinton’s. In dribs and drabs, second halves around the country are getting going. Let’s hope for goals, goals, goals. Eddie Howe made a double change for Newcastle on 38 minutes, with only one of those enforced, as Jamal Lascelles hobbled off with Sven Botman his replacement. Howe used that moment as an opportunity to get Alexander Isak on the pitch to play up top with Callum Wilson. Youngster Lewis Miley was sacrificed. Let’s see if that has an impact after the break. Luton are deservedly in front as things stand. And the award for best Christmas jumper of the year, 2023, goes to: A half-time email from concerned Tottenham supporter Alexandra Ashton: From the 40th minute up until the end of the half Everton have been carving out chances at will. If their players could finish their chances we’d be on level terms or even behind 2-3 at this point! We’ve been playing some lovely stuff for the vast majority of the half but the players need to keep their focus and learn to see out the half/match, under the cosh for 10 minutes and conceding a myriad of chances. The scoreline is very, very flattering, but I’m not complaining. Premier League: Fulham 0-0 Burnley; Luton 1-0 Newcastle; Nottm Forest 0-0 Bournemouth; Tottenham 2-0 Everton. Championship: Blackburn 1-0 Watford; Leicester 0-0 Rotherham; Boro 1-0 West Brom; Norwich 0-0 Huddersfield; Plymouth 1-2 Birmingham; QPR 0-1 So’ton; Sheff Weds 1-0 Cardiff; Stoke 0-0 Millwall; Sunderland 0-1 Coventry. League One: Barnsley 1-2 Stevenage; Blackpool 1-1 Bristol Rovers; Bolton 3-0 L Orient; Carlisle 0-1 Cheltenham; Charlton 1-0 Burton; N’hampton 0-0 Oxford; Portsmouth 1-0 Fleetwood; Reading 1-0 Wigan; Shrewsbury 0-0 Peterborough; Wycombe 0-0 P Vale. League Two: Accrington 1-1 Walsall; Grimsby 0-1 Harrogate; Morecambe 0-1 MK Dons; Sutton 0-1 Mansfield; Tranmere 0-1 Swindon; Wrexham 0-0 Newport. Added time at TH Stadium and Vicario does well to maintain Spurs’ 2-0 lead with an excellent save from Jack Harrison. Into the same sort of time at the City Ground and Forest are (just about) keeping Bournemouth at bay, amid waves of Cherries pressure. An email from Jeff Sax asks: “How is referee doing at Burnley game?” I’ve not heard much from that game, but presumably no headlines equate to a solid start for Rebecca Welch on her Premier League debut. Championship: The goals are flowing like mulled wine now in the second tier! Plymouth have pulled one back against Birmingham, Southampton lead at QPR through Taylor Harwood-Bellis but Leicester continue to be frustrated by lowly Rotherham. It’s 0-0 at the KP. 42 mins: As we now expect from Ange-ball, Spurs are showing no sign of slowing their tempo or shutting things in the hope of getting to half-time with their two-goal lead intact. Nope, it’s high-line, high-energy, expansive stuff from Tottenham and it’s keeping Everton interested, to say the least. Championship: Make that five goalless games and put Middlesbrough on Santa’s good list. They’ve scored against West Brom via Morgan Rogers. Birmingham have a second at Plymouth, too. Championship: Most games have had 40 minutes and goals are like gold dust. Only Birmingham, Blackburn and Sheffield Wednesday have managed to find the net. Six games are goalless. Yawn. 37 mins: Luton are pushing hard for a second goal against Newcastle, who really haven’t turned up at Kenilworth Road as yet. Dubravka does well to deny Adebayo and the home fans crank up the volume. They’re bang up for this, as you’d expect. Looks like another injury issue for Newcastle, too, as Lascelles limps off. On Willy Boly’s red card, Samuel Campbell makes a salient point: I didn’t think VAR can intervene on second yellows? Either way I am not sure I see the big fuss. That’s the rules these days. Ideally I don’t think it should be but these days you can get punished for catching someone on the follow-through, even if you get the ball and even if there is no intent or malice. I’m sure many Forest fans will disagree Samuel. I personally think it was very, very harsh. Scottish Premiership: No goals yet in Celtic v Livingston, nor Hearts v St Mirren. Kilmarnock lead St Johnstone 2-0 in the other game, with Ross County v Hibs postponed due to a frozen pitch. Is it 2015? A replay of Boly’s second yellow at the City Ground shows him clearly winning the ball. I’m absolutely stunned that’s been able to stand. But Forest are playing with 10. League One: Bolton are now 3-0 up against Leyton Orient and cruising; Blackpool have bee pegged back at home by Bristol Rovers to make it 1-1; Stevenage, Charlton and Cheltenham all have 1-0 leads. Another player coming back to haunt his former club! Andros Townsend heads the home side in front. It came from a corner – and that’s Townsend’s first ever goal for Luton. He holds up a No 4 shirt in tribute to Tom Lockyer. Goodness me, this isn’t the start Nuno Espirito Santo was wanting. Two yellow card offences in the opening 25 minutes from the former Nuno Wolves’ favourite Boly means Forest are down to 10 men. 21 mins: Callum Wilson should really have put Newcastle 1-0 up at Luton. Kaminski to the rescue for the Hatters – but Wilson’s header was straight at him. 20 mins: Is this signed and sealed for Spurs already? Everton have been far more open than you’d expect from a Dyche side and it’s cost them so far. Idrissa Gueye is down injured to make matters worse for the visitors. Two-nil and, of course, it’s Son! Everton are undone by a simple corner routine, with Jordan Pickford parrying it out into a melee and Son Heung-min pounces on the rebound, scuffing it into the corner to double Spurs’ lead. Championship: Wayne Rooney’s Birmingham (TM) are 1-0 up away at Plymouth, Jay Stansfield netting the opener. It goes from bad to worse for managerless Argyle. Mr MK Dons himself makes history in League Two today. 13 mins: Johnson fancied his chances of adding a quickfire second for Spurs, after making the opener. Emerson Royal’s cross finds the former Forest man, who hits it cleanly, but over the crossbar. 11 mins: Burnley have made the brighter start, confounding the pre-match predictions, away at Fulham, with one or two early Clarets’ chances. Still goalless though. Richarlison against his former club! A nicely worked goal by Spurs and the Brazilian steals in at the near post to give his team an early lead. Good stuff from Brennan Johnson to create it. League One: Bang, bang! Just like that, Bolton are 2-0 up on Leyton Orient already. High-flying Stevenage also have the lead at Barnsley. 7 mins: Some early promise for Everton at Spurs, with Romero bailing out his defence after an incisive Toffees counterattack came through Calvert-Lewin. The Merseysiders are in good voice in the away section in north London. Championship: An early goal for Blackburn against fellow playoff hopefuls Watford. Adam Wharton has scored inside three minutes at Ewood Park. Leeds were rampant in the early kick-off at Elland Road: Erik ten Hag offers some answers to Manchester United’s current malaise, speaking to BBC Sport: I think it was a decent 72 minutes where we didn’t take our chances. We should’ve gone in [at half time] in the lead but we didn’t and then it was one moment of switching off. In this moment, we are underperforming. There are reasons for it, we have many injuries, so the team will be better if the injured ones return. We have to be calm, stick together, stick to the plan, we have to do it together. 2 mins: The man in the mask, Tottenham’s Dejan Kulusevski, is also one of the form men in the Premier League at the moment. He’s on the ball early doors at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, playing in a central attacking role with some license to roam. The whistles are sounded around the grounds. Let’s do this. Nuno is facing a whole heap of questions as he takes charge of Nottingham Forest for the first time today, including this one from Joe Pearson on email … “Has Nuno never watched Origi at Liverpool? Divock is most effective as a last minute substitute. Just ask Everton.” Lovely touch from Newcastle fans at Luton, here. “We want to win for Locks,” said Luton’s Rob Edwards before today’s game against Newcastle. Expect Kenilworth Road to show its appreciation for Hatters’ captain Tom Lockyer this afternoon. Sachin Nakrani reports here on a club still reeling from last week’s harrowing events at Bournemouth. Breaking news: Manchester United still aren’t very good. Jacob Steinberg reports from the London Stadium: Let’s get excited and interested in these upcoming games, then, shall we? What are the key talking points? It will be fascinating to see Sean Dyche’s solid, sitting-in Everton playing away against free-flowing, Ange-ball Spurs – even if Tottenham’s injuries could make them a little vulnerable in defence. Left-back Ben Davies is playing centre-back, while right-back Emerson Royal lines up at left-back. Something for Dominic Calvert-Lewin to exploit, methinks. At Kenilworth Road, will we see more signs of fatigue in the legs of Eddie Howe’s hard-running Newcastle? It appeared the case at Chelsea in midweek, but the Magpies tend to rouse themselves for a big win every now and then. Luton will be inspired. It’s absolutely no surprise to anyone that Nuno has gone straight to a back three in his first Forest game. Willy Boly was always going to play. Aside from the formation, though, the new manager has picked an attacking side including messrs Wood, Elanga, Gibbs-White and Origi. Meanwhile, you’d make Fulham big favourites to topple Burnley at Craven Cottage, with all eyes on Rebecca Welch as the female referee makes a slice of history. The early full-time scores are in: West Ham 2-0 Manchester United Leeds 4-0 Ipswich A good day (so far) for raucous home crowds. Time for a pre-match/end of year quiz before the 3pm action starts? Why not! Fulham: Leno; Castagne, Tosin, Bassey, Robinson; Palhinha, Cairney, Pereira; Wilson, Iwobi, Muniz. Subs: Rodak, Tete, Reed, Ballo-Toure, Decordova-Reid, Lukic, Vinicius, Diop, Harris. Burnley: Trafford; Vitinho, O’Shea, Beyer, Taylor; Larsen, Berge, Brownhill, Odobert; Foster, Amdouni. Subs: Muric, Rodriguez, Roberts, Redmond, Zaroury, Cullen, Tresor, Delcroix, Obafemi. Nottm Forest: Turner; Boly, Murillo, Mangala; Williams, Yates, Gibbs-White, Toffolo; Origi, Wood, Elanga. Subs: Vlachodimos, Tavares, Kouyate, Hudson-Odoi, Dominguez, Niakhate, Oliveira, Montiel, Aina. Bournemouth: Neto; Smith, Zabarnyi, Senesi, Billing; Cook, Christie; Tavernier, Semenyo, Ouattara; Solanke. Subs: Travers, Mepham, Brooks, Rothwell, Scott, Sinisterra, Kluivert, Moore, Greenwood. Luton: Kaminski; Mengi, Osho, Bell; Kabore, Lokonga, Barkley, Doughty; Townsend, Brown, Adebayo. Subs: Krul, Andersen, Ogbene, Morris, Woodrow, Chong, Pelly, Clark, Giles. Newcastle: Dubravka; Trippier, Lascelles, Schar, Burn; Miley, Guimaraes, Longstaff; Almiron, Gordon, Wilson. Subs: Karius, Dummett, Botman, Ritchie, Isak, Krafth, Hall, Livramento, A.Murphy. Tottenham: Vicario; Porro, Romero, Davies, Royal; Sarr, Skipp; Johnson, Kulusevski, Son; Richarlison. Subs: Forster, Dorrington, Dier, Phillips, Hojbjerg, Lo Celso, Bryan, Donley, Veliz. Everton: Pickford; Patterson, Tarkowski, Branthwaite, Mykolenko; Onana, Gueye, Garner; McNeil, Harrison, Calvert-Lewin. Subs: Virginia, Lonergan, Keane, Danjuma, Beto, Gomes, Godfrey, Chermiti, Hunt. That all important team news is dropping in five minutes. Five, four, three … Leeds raced into a 3-0 half-time lead over high-flying Ipswich in the early Championship kick-off. Who saw that coming? The second half at Elland Road is here: West Ham v Manchester United hasn’t quite ignited yet, although Alejandro Garnacho will be ruing a big first half miss for the visitors. The second half is under way now and Scott Murray has you covered. As for me, I’ll bring you team news at 2pm before building towards the big 3pm kick-offs. Merry Christmas Eve Eve and welcome along to this festive feast of a football blog. It should be a cracker of a Saturday afternoon, but who will emerge top of the tree and who could be facing the sack? Ok, enough of the Christmas puns … there’s no doubt Tottenham versus Everton is the pick of the 3pm games in the Premier League; a really tough one to call given the stupendous form of Sean Dyche’s side and the injuries affecting Big Ange and co in north London. Elsewhere, can Luton Town rally together after the harrowing Tom Lockyer incident and shock Newcastle? Can Nuno Espírito Santo get off to a winning start at Nottingham Forest against Bournemouth? And can Fulham win a home game 5-0 for a third successive time? They host beleaguered Burnley. If that’s not enough for you, there’s four games in the Scottish top flight today and nine Championship matches kicking off at 3pm, as well as a full schedule of fixtures in League One and League Two, plus a few in Serie A and La Liga. Stay for the feast!",

We’ve been playing some lovely stuff for the vast majority of the half but the players need to keep their focus and learn to see out the half/match, under the cosh for 10 minutes and conceding a myriad of chances.<br><br>The scoreline is very, very flattering, but I’m not complaining.</p> \n</blockquote>"
