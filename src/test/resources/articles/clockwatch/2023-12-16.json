Extremely worrying signs, especially in the wake of his collapse at the play-off final last May, and his enforced substitution at Brentford earlier this month. Thankfully his club have reported that Lockyer is “responsive” and receiving treatment at hospital. Here’s to further good news and a full recovery; we send our love and best wishes.

                "bodyText": "On a normal day, everyone would be talking about Crystal Palace’s dramatic comeback at Manchester City, who continue to misfire in their quest for a fourth consecutive Premier League title. But instead the thoughts of fans across the country will be with Luton Town captain Tom Lockyer, who collapsed during his team’s match at Bournemouth. Extremely worrying signs, especially in the wake of his collapse at the play-off final last May, and his enforced substitution at Brentford earlier this month. Thankfully his club have reported that Lockyer is “responsive” and receiving treatment at hospital. Here’s to further good news and a full recovery; we send our love and best wishes. Godspeed, and thanks for reading this Clockwatch. Manchester City 2-2 Crystal Palace. “It was, though, a classic rope-a-dope comeback from the visitors who were 2-0 behind after 76 minutes,” reports Jamie Jackson. Luton Town have posted an update on their captain Tom Lockyer’s condition on X. Lockyer is “thankfully responsive and has been taken to hospital” though the club “don’t know the full extent of what happened and what the next steps are at this stage”. They thank Bournemouth and the medical teams of both clubs for their “absolutely amazing” response. The message continued: “We thank everyone for the wonderful applause and singing of Locks’ name inside the stadium at such a difficult time. Now is the time for all of our players, staff and supporters to come together as we always do and give our love and support to Tom and his family. Our thoughts are with him and them all.” Newcastle 3-0 Fulham. “The psychological damage sustained by Eddie Howe’s team during a trio of consecutive defeats looked, if not quite fully repaired, decently patched up,” writes Louise Taylor. Chelsea 2-0 Sheffield United. “This was not a performance that will lure Mauricio Pochettino into thinking that the corner has been turned and a charge up the table is on the way,” reports Jacob Steinberg. FULL TIME: Plymouth 3-2 Rotherham (Whittaker 90+6). Morgan Whittaker decides it late at Home Park. The second half lasted 53 minutes; the first just over an hour. FULL TIME: Celtic 0-2 Hearts. Celtic were booed off after first-half goals from Lawrence Shankland and Stephen Kingsley earned Hearts their first Premiership win at Parkhead since 2007. Meanwhile two results from aforementioned matches in the Scottish Championship: Dundee United 0-1 Raith; ICT 1-2 Arbroath. Championship full-times Bristol City 1-0 Sunderland Hull City 3-0 Cardiff City Ipswich Town 2-2 Norwich City Leeds United 1-1 Coventry City Millwall 1-1 Huddersfield Town Plymouth Argyle 2-2 Rotherham United (L) Preston North End 1-5 Watford Sheffield Wednesday 2-1 QPR Southampton 4-0 Blackburn Rovers Swansea City 1-2 Middlesbrough Bournemouth 1a1 Luton Town (match abandoned after 65 minutes) Chelsea 2-0 Sheffield United Manchester City 2-2 Crystal Palace Newcastle United 3-0 Fulham Newcastle snap their three-game losing run with an easy win over ten-man Fulham. They have lost Joelinton and Fabian Schar to injury, though. The whistle goes at the Etihad, and the champions have now won just one of their last six Premier League games. What a comeback by Palace. The Blues move into the top half. Phil Foden catches Jean-Philippe Mateta in the box. Michael Olise dispatches the spot kick calmly, and the champions are in danger of dropping two more precious points. Bournemouth v Luton. Rob Edwards was understandably emotional after Tom Lockyer’s collapse at the play-off final last season. The Luton boss is no less shaken today, walking around the pitch to applaud every fan in Dean Court for their patience and support. “Thank you,” he mouths to the crowd. Glassy eyed, he taps his heart in a gesture of love, clearly only just managing to keep himself together. Bournemouth 1-1 Luton. The referee Simon Hooper has talked to Andoni Iraola and Rob Edwards, and opted to call the game off in the wake of Tom Lockyer’s worrying collapse. The latest on Lockyer is that he is “alert and responsive”. His Luton team-mates come back onto the pitch to applaud their fans. Bournemouth come on too, and all four sides of the stadium offer warm applause that translates as a message of support for the stricken Luton captain. Love and best wishes to Lockyer in the hope of a full recovery. Dan Burn sees his header saved from close range, but dispatches the rebound. Southampton 2-0 Blackburn. Penalty for Saints. Charly Alcaraz attempts a Panenka … and scuffs it. That shouldn’t matter against ten-man Rovers. Chelsea 2-0 Sheffield United. Armando Broja somehow manages to miss from a couple of yards out. No matter, because the Blades are offering nothing in attack. It’s not quite over yet at the Etihad. Jean-Philippe Mateta taps in to halve Palace’s deficit. Bournemouth 1-1 Luton. The BBC have corroborated that report. Lockyer is “alert and responsive in the tunnel.” Bournemouth 1-1 Luton. There’s still no play at Dean Court. But we can tentatively relay some very welcome news: Sky Sports report that Tom Lockyer is “alert and responsive”. GOAL. Southampton 2-0 Blackburn (S Armstrong 64). Saints are now two up, through Stuart Armstrong. Blackburn’s Callum Brittain had been sent off ten minutes earlier for a second yellow. Miguel Almiron doubles Newcastle’s lead against the ten men. Bournemouth 1-1 Luton. Tom Lockyer is now being carried down the tunnel. Dean Court rises as one to applaud him off. He takes everyone’s love and best wishes with him. Bournemouth 1-1 Luton. All of the players have been taken off the pitch at Dean Court as paramedics continue to treat the stricken Tom Lockyer. Extreme concern. The stadium is understandably subdued. On Sky Soccer Saturday, Tim Sherwood stresses that he doesn’t want to speculate – the cameras have understandably been taken off Lockyer – but reports that while fans are extremely anxious, there have been ripples of applause, which he’s hoping can be read as a positive sign. Here’s hoping that is indeed the case. The Luton fans chant their support for their captain. Nicolas Jackson doubles Chelsea’s advantage at Stamford Bridge. Newcastle take the lead against ten-man Fulham. Bournemouth 1-1 Luton. Worrying reports from Dean Court as Tom Lockyer goes down. He’s motionless. Rob Edwards races onto the pitch as play is stopped. He takes his players off. Paramedics are currently treating the Luton captain. No speculation, though minds will inevitably go back to his collapse in the play-off final last season. He also went down at half-time against Brentford a couple of weeks ago. Thoughts, wishes and prayers. Rico Lewis volleys home to double City’s lead, minutes after Julian Alvarez thought he’d scored direct from a free kick. Rodri’s interference chalked that one off. But the champions go two up after all. It’s five in six for Dominic Solanke, who is finally delivering on all that early promise. Raheem Sterling tees up Cole Palmer for the breakthrough at Stamford Bridge. There’s a quick VAR check for offside but Nicolas Jackson wasn’t interfering with play. It’s 1-1 between Plymouth and Rotherham at half-time. Injuries and some questionable challenges meant a feisty first half lasted one hour and 19 seconds. And another! Iain Rowan tapping home from close range this time. “First few months of season: Howe has worked miracles with Newcastle. He has the same group of players and they never stop, run and press until they drop. Next few months of season: Why are the Newcastle players getting injured all the time? It’s a mystery and we may never know.” A couple of open goals to report. “It occurs to me that ‘something’s not quite right under Rodgers’ is, if you see what I mean, its own explanation,” writes James Humphries. “Why they went for him again after Ange left is a mystery for the ages.” Meanwhile Niall Mullen adds: “Yes, it’s a real mystery as to what Faustian pact Eddie Howe has made to earn such bad luck.” Championship half-times Bristol City 1-0 Sunderland Hull City 1-0 Cardiff City Leeds United 0-0 Coventry City Millwall 0-0 Huddersfield Town Plymouth Argyle 1-1 Rotherham United Preston North End 1-1 Watford Sheffield Wednesday 0-1 QPR Southampton 1-0 Blackburn Rovers Swansea City 0-1 Middlesbrough Bournemouth 0-1 Luton Town Chelsea 0-0 Sheffield United Manchester City 1-0 Crystal Palace Newcastle United 0-0 Fulham GOAL! Southampton 1-0 Blackburn (Edozie 44). Samuel Edozie breaks the deadlock at St Mary’s from close range. Saints are unbeaten since that four-game losing streak in September, and chipping away at the gap between the top two and the chasing pack. Manchester City 1-0 Crystal Palace. Jean-Philippe Mateta tries to round Ederson but ends up running away from goal. Just as well for City keeper Ederson, who slides into him outside the box but only cops a yellow with a defender getting back in position. All quiet at the moment. Chance to report, then, that Inverness Caley Thistle are 2-1 down at home to Arbroath. Duncan Ferguson had gone seven unbeaten upon taking over the Caley Jags, but now he’s in danger of losing his third match in four. Newcastle 0-0 Fulham. Another injury for Newcastle. This is getting old. Joelinton this time, and it’s another hammy. Lewis Miley replaces him. “Did Eddie Howe break into a pharaoh’s tomb to activate his baneful curse?” asks Scott Bassett. “How else can this run of injuries be explained?” Newcastle 0-0 Fulham. Anthony Gordon twangs the crossbar from close range. Another one to file under Easier To Score. “Newcastle fans are famous for their Brown Ale-infused boat trips to Craven Cottage, which pretty much turn into Gene Wilder’s LSD-Gondola scene from Willie Wonka And The Chocolate Factory by the time they dock in London,” writes Chris Paraskevas. “Do Fulham fans have an equivalent aquatic trip up to St. James’ Park? I’m thinking it’d be much more Bob Hoskins from The Long Good Friday in tone and social etiquette: easy pace, a few nibblies and some champers as they cruise out of the Thames.” GOAL! Celtic 0-2 Hearts (Kingsley 30). Stephen Kingsley whistles a free kick into the net from 25 yards. Something not quite right at Celtic under Brendan Rodgers. Bournemouth 0-1 Luton. Another good chance for Elijah Adebayo, who slices wide when it might have been easier to hit the target. Luton continue to show signs of life after their slow start to their first Premier League season. Manchester City 1-0 Crystal Palace. Grealish’s curler was nearly ruled out for offside. It looked like that from one angle. But another proves all was well. The goal stands. More VAR fun for Mr Roy to appreciate. It had been coming, and the way this match has been going, don’t expect the scoring to end here. Already looking forward to Roy Hodgson’s steam-powered post-match interview. Newcastle 0-0 Fulham. Raul Jimenez clatters into Sean Longstaff in spectacular martial-arts style. There’s no need for it, and although the referee initially shows yellow, VAR entices him over to the screen, and he’s soon changing his mind. Up pops the red card, and Fulham are down to ten men. Jimenez may have had the cob on, having recently been slapped by Jamaal Lascelles. Running hot, he’s now running a bath. Back up to the auld country, and here’s the in-no-way-partial Simon McMahon. “Ain’t no bout adout it, Scott, the game of the day, and indeed the season so far, is at Tannadice where Raith Rovers are the visitors. Dundee United are unbeaten and on 34 points after 14 games, yet trail Raith, who have played a game more, by two points after yet another late winner for the jammy Fifers in midweek. A win for United today, however, will see them leapfrog Raith and return to the top of the table. So, Jim Goodwin’s team talk should be pretty simple, paraphrasing Brian Clough. ‘I don’t care how we do it - just win.’” Chelsea 0-0 Sheffield United. It feels like a matter of time for Manchester City at the Etihad; it’s a similar story at Stamford Bridge, where the Blades are struggling to string anything together. Chelsea well on top. GOAL! Celtic 0-1 Hearts (Shankland 15). Celtic went down to a late smash-and-grab at Kilmarnock last weekend, and the Scottish champions are in bother again. Lawrence Shankland powers home a header from a corner for the visitors at Parkhead. Newcastle 0-0 Fulham. An early setback for the Toon, as Fabian Schär pulls up before limping off. Yet another injury for a team currently running low on inspiration and luck. Emil Krafth comes on in his stead. Manchester City 0-0 Crystal Palace. Rodri goes close. The visitors can’t get a sniff. An opening goal surely just a matter of time. Bournemouth 0-1 Luton. The Cherries have responded well to going behind, Marcus Tavernier nearly levelling up from close range. A brisk opening on the south coast. Manchester City 0-0 Crystal Palace. Dean Henderson is back for Palace, and he’s already making his presence felt, denying Julian Alvarez from opening the scoring early doors with a header. The champions on top at the Etihad, though, pretty much as expected against a woefully out-of-sorts Palace. Elijah Anuoluwapo Oluwaferanmi Oluwatomi Oluwalana Ayomikulehin Adebayo! He heads home from a corner as Luton – coming off the back of admirable defeats to Arsenal and Manchester City – take a shock early lead at Dean Court. Here we go, then. “And if VAR had been in action then it would have been 4-0!” adds Richard Hirst, refusing to let it lie. Teams are trotting out all over the country. We’ll be off in a couple of minutes. Pre-match entertainment. “Let’s remember 40 years ago,” begins Richard Hirst. “Newcastle 1-4 Fulham, when SuperMac’s team of midgets - Houghton, Lewington, Davies etc - destroyed Newcastle (including K Keegan), and Ray Houghton scored one of the goals of the season. Even Motty was impressed.” Scotland’s big game will be played at Hampden tomorrow. Ewan Murray previews the League Cup final here … … while Celtic have the opportunity to extend their lead at the top in their great rivals’ absence. They welcome Hearts to Parkhead this afternoon. FULL TIME: Ipswich Town 2-2 Norwich City. That draw puts Ipswich level on points with Leicester at the top of the Championship table … … and that’s a state of affairs that won’t change today. Leicester aren’t playing again until Monday evening, when they travel to Birmingham for a regioinal stramash given added morbo by Wagatha Christie. Leeds and Southampton can close the gap this afternoon, though: they host Coventry City and Blackburn Rovers respectively. West Brom welcome Stoke tomorrow. FULL TIME: Ipswich Town 2-2 Norwich City. The first Championship result of the weekend is in, and the Old Farm derby has ended all square. Luke McLaughlin was all over that one, as Ed Sheeran cavorted in the stand to cheer on his Ipswich heroes, a slightly more down-home version of the Taylor Swift / Kansas City Chiefs dynamic. Newcastle v Fulham. Eddie Howe makes two changes to the side that lost 2-1 at home to Milan. Dan Burn and Sean Longstaff start, with Lewis Miley dropping to the bench and Kieran Trippier suspended. Marco Silva also makes two swaps, with Issa Diop and Harry Wilson replacing Calvin Bassey and Willian, the latter having tweaked his hamstring but taking up a place on the bench anyway. Manchester City v Crystal Palace. City gave their starting XI a good old shoogle for the dead rubber against Red Star Belgrade, so let’s go back to last weekend’s win over Luton. Just one change to the side that started the victory at Kenilworth Road, with Rico Lewis nudging Mateo Kovacic onto the bench. Erling Haaland is still missing. Palace make five changes in the wake of the late defeat by Liverpool last Saturday: Dean Henderson makes his Premier League debut for Palace, replacing the injured Sam Johnstone, while Tyrick Mitchell, Jairo Ridewald, Michael Olise and Jean-Philippe Mateta return. Chelsea v Sheffield United. Five changes to the Chelsea team after their loss at Everton last weekend. Robert Sanchez is injured so Đorđe Petrović makes his Stamford Bridge debut in goal. Thiago Silva, Levi Colwill, Raheem Sterling and Nicolas Jackson are all welcomed back, as is Christopher Nkunku, who returns from injury and could make his debut. Sheffield United meanwhile make two changes after their win over Brentford: Oli McBurnie returns from suspension to take the place of William Osula, who drops to the bench; Max Lowe replaces Jack Robinson, who is suspended. Bournemouth v Luton. No big surprise that Bournemouth are unchanged in the wake of their jawline-lowering 3-0 romp at Old Trafford. Luton however make two changes despite pushing Manchester City hard last Sunday. Issa Kabore and Albert Sambi Lokonga return, while Ryan Giles drops to the bench and Marvelous Nakamba misses out through suspension. Bournemouth: Neto, Smith, Zabarnyi, Senesi, Kerkez, Cook, Christie, Semenyo, Kluivert, Tavernier, Solanke. Subs: Mepham, Brooks, Rothwell, Ouattara, Scott, Sinisterra, Moore, Billing, Travers. Luton Town: Kaminski, Mengi, Lockyer, Bell, Doughty, Sambi Lokonga, Barkley, Kabore, Townsend, Brown, Adebayo. Subs: Osho, Andersen, Ogbene, Morris, Chong, Mpanzu, Clark, Krul, Giles.

Subs: Dummett, Botman, Ritchie, Krafth, Karius, Hall, Gillespie, Alex Murphy, Miley.

Subs: Rodak, Tete, Reed, Ballo-Toure, De Cordova-Reid, Rodrigo Muniz, Willian, Lukic, Vinicius. No 12.30pm kick-off this week. That’s because last night, this happened … … which means the Premier League table now looks like this. On the face of it, all of the 3pm Premier League kick-offs … Bournemouth v Luton Town Chelsea v Sheffield United Manchester City v Crystal Palace Newcastle United v Fulham … look like home bankers. But nothing’s ever certain in sport, that’s why we keep turning up. So you never know. Team news when we have it!",
