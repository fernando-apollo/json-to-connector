That has lifted spirits at Luton but there remains a heaviness around the training ground after this most harrowing of periods. In that regard it has helped having representatives of Sporting Chance, the charity that provides free mental health support for professional sportspeople, on site. Edwards also spoke to his players upon their return to work on Tuesday and for all concerned there is a desire to use what happened as a galvanising force, starting with Saturday’s visit of Newcastle.</p> <p>“We want to win for Locks,” said Edwards. “We all care for him and love him and if we can harness that [against Newcastle] then great. It will be an emotional day for sure.</p> <p>“It was difficult [speaking with the players on Tuesday] but it was important I did so and put them at ease. A lot of them have been in contact with Tom as well, and believe it or not he’s been his usual self, laughing and joking, talking about how he’d do anything to get out of our Christmas do. It’s incredible how he’s been throughout this.”</p> <p>While in hospital Lockyer had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator fitted, a device designed to shock the heart should a person enter cardiac arrest. It is hoped that will allow the 29-year-old to return to action. Time will tell, given he has suffered two on-field collapses owing to heart issues, having also done so during May’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/27/luton-promoted-to-premier-league-after-shootout-victory-against-coventry\" title=\"\">Championship playoff final victory over Coventry</a>.</p> <p>Edwards, quite understandably, had no desire to discuss Lockyer’s future – “All that matters is that he’s OK. That’s it. Bottom line” – while stressing that the Welshman’s two emergencies were unrelated, the first being down to an atrial fibrillation, a condition that causes an irregular and abnormally fast heart rate. Lockyer underwent surgery and was cleared for pre-season. The centre-back has started all but two of their 16 completed Premier League fixtures, proving an inspiration in more ways than one.</p> <p>“Tom’s one of the most important players this club has ever had,” said Edwards. “He’s played a huge part in the success we’ve had here having dragged himself up the divisions to become a Premier League footballer and I know his name will be sung by our supporters for a long, long time.”</p> <p>That will no doubt be the case on Saturday, especially during the fourth minute – No 4 being his squad number – when those in attendance at Kenilworth Road will be asked to stand and applaud Lockyer. For Edwards that moment will also be one of reflection and thanks, and in that regard he was at pains to again praise Bournemouth for how they dealt with last week’s incident, the medical staff in particular. Their quick and skilled efforts meant only two minutes passed between Lockyer receiving treatment and being resuscitated, an incredibly short time compared with how long it took Fabrice Muamba and Christian Eriksen to be revived after on-pitch heart-related collapses.</p> <p>“We’ll forever have a special relationship with that club,” said Edwards. “Going back there [for the rearranged game] will be a unique feeling, for sure.”</p> <p>That is for the future. For now all that matters at Luton is seeing Lockyer make a full recovery and for the club as a whole to heal. “It’s been a difficult week for everyone, Tom and his family especially,” said Edwards, who revealed he had received regular text messages of support from Steve Cooper during the past week despite Cooper having to deal with being sacked by Nottingham Forest. “I hope on Saturday we can do them proud.”</p>",

That has lifted spirits at Luton but there remains a heaviness around the training ground after this most harrowing of periods.

Edwards also spoke to his players upon their return to work on Tuesday and for all concerned there is a desire to use what happened as a galvanising force, starting with Saturday’s visit of Newcastle.</p> <p>“We want to win for Locks,” said Edwards. “We all care for him and love him and if we can harness that [against Newcastle] then great. It will be an emotional day for sure.</p> <p>“It was difficult [speaking with the players on Tuesday] but it was important I did so and put them at ease. A lot of them have been in contact with Tom as well, and believe it or not he’s been his usual self, laughing and joking, talking about how he’d do anything to get out of our Christmas do. It’s incredible how he’s been throughout this.”</p> <p>While in hospital Lockyer had an implantable cardioverter defibrillator fitted, a device designed to shock the heart should a person enter cardiac arrest. It is hoped that will allow the 29-year-old to return to action. Time will tell, given he has suffered two on-field collapses owing to heart issues, having also done so during May’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/may/27/luton-promoted-to-premier-league-after-shootout-victory-against-coventry\" title=\"\">Championship playoff final victory over Coventry</a>.</p> <p>Edwards, quite understandably, had no desire to discuss Lockyer’s future – “All that matters is that he’s OK. That’s it. Bottom line” – while stressing that the Welshman’s two emergencies were unrelated, the first being down to an atrial fibrillation, a condition that causes an irregular and abnormally fast heart rate. Lockyer underwent surgery and was cleared for pre-season. The centre-back has started all but two of their 16 completed Premier League fixtures, proving an inspiration in more ways than one.</p> <p>“Tom’s one of the most important players this club has ever had,” said Edwards. “He’s played a huge part in the success we’ve had here having dragged himself up the divisions to become a Premier League footballer and I know his name will be sung by our supporters for a long, long time.”</p> <p>That will no doubt be the case on Saturday, especially during the fourth minute – No 4 being his squad number – when those in attendance at Kenilworth Road will be asked to stand and applaud Lockyer. For Edwards that moment will also be one of reflection and thanks, and in that regard he was at pains to again praise Bournemouth for how they dealt with last week’s incident, the medical staff in particular. Their quick and skilled efforts meant only two minutes passed between Lockyer receiving treatment and being resuscitated, an incredibly short time compared with how long it took Fabrice Muamba and Christian Eriksen to be revived after on-pitch heart-related collapses.</p> <p>“We’ll forever have a special relationship with that club,” said Edwards. “Going back there [for the rearranged game] will be a unique feeling, for sure.”</p> <p>That is for the future. For now all that matters at Luton is seeing Lockyer make a full recovery and for the club as a whole to heal. “It’s been a difficult week for everyone, Tom and his family especially,” said Edwards, who revealed he had received regular text messages of support from Steve Cooper during the past week despite Cooper having to deal with being sacked by Nottingham Forest. “I hope on Saturday we can do them proud.”</p>",
