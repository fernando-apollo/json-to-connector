        "bodyText": "Luton’s Premier League match at Bournemouth on Saturday was abandoned after their captain, Tom Lockyer, collapsed on the pitch after a cardiac arrest. The match was stopped in the 59th minute as medics tended to Lockyer, who collapsed off the ball. Players and staff members from both clubs were clearly in distress as the incident unfolded at the Vitality Stadium, with Luton’s Issa Kaboré appearing to pray on the side of the pitch. Both teams were sent to the changing rooms as Lockyer received treatment. In a statement, Luton Town said: “Our medical staff have confirmed that the Hatters captain suffered cardiac arrest on the pitch, but was responsive by the time he was taken off on the stretcher.

The Wales defender returned to action for the start of the new season and had made 15 appearances so far in all competitions before Saturday’s match. Wales posted on X: “Our thoughts are with Tom Lockyer.” Gary Lineker tweeted: “Reports coming in that Tom Lockyer is now alert and responsive. Thank heavens.” He added: “Wish him well.”",

I couldn’t stop crying on the floor. It was probably a lot worse for everyone else watching than it was for me because as soon as I came back around, I was fine. I never really felt in any danger and it definitely wasn’t as bad as it looked.”</p> \n<p>Lockyer said that he had the operation to fix the issue “and it shouldn’t happen again”, adding “there’s not really any reason to say why that happened”.</p> \n<p>“I’ve been given the all-clear – it is what it is and I just want to draw a line under it now and move on,” he said.</p> \n<p>The Wales defender returned to action for the start of the new season and had made 15 appearances so far in all competitions before Saturday’s match.</p> \n<p>Wales posted on X: “Our thoughts are with Tom Lockyer.”</p> \n<p>Gary Lineker tweeted: “Reports coming in that Tom Lockyer is now alert and responsive. Thank heavens.” He added: “Wish him well.”</p>"
